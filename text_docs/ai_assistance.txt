I used ChatGPT (GPT-4) during the development of my Monopoly project to assist me in understanding the structure of the existing codebase,
shaping logic for new features, and improving the UI. I did not use GitHub Copilot or other AI tools.

The AI assistance was primarily used in three areas:

1. Jail Logic:
I asked ChatGPT for help in understanding how the different files (py files) interact. One of the prompts I used was:

"Help me implement the jail logic in my Monopoly game. If a player lands on 'Go To Jail', they should be moved to jail and stay there unless they roll doubles or pay after 3 turns.
How should I structure this across my player and controller classes?"

Based on this, I was able to:
- Add `__in_jail` and `__jail_turns` to the Player class.
- Write methods like `go_to_jail()`, `leave_jail()`, and `increment_jail_turns()`.
- Modify `move()` to block jailed players.
- Handle jail logic in controller.py (rolling for doubles, auto-payment, etc.).

ChatGPT helped me shape the logic and troubleshoot the flow, but I wrote and tested the actual code myself.

2. Player Name Selection:
To improve the game experience, I added a prompt for players to enter their names. I asked:

"How can I use Tkinter to ask the player to enter their name at the start of the game?"

From there, I implemented `ask_for_player_names()` using `simpledialog`, and modified the controller to use those names when creating Player instances. The AI helped guide the design but I handled the integration.

3. UI Redesign:
This is where I relied more heavily on AI, since I was not very familiar with Tkinter styling or layout management. My prompt was:

"Make my Monopoly game UI look more modern using Tkinter. I want the logo at the top, the board on the left, action buttons in the middle, and property card image on the right. Below that, I want two black text boxes for game messages."

ChatGPT suggested using frames, `ttk.Style`, and provided layout examples. However, I had to adjust and debug many things manually:
- The AI layout didnâ€™t fully work with my window size, so I resized frames and manually fixed the padding and alignment.
- I reduced text box height, changed the frame structure, and repositioned widgets so everything fit on screen.

So while ChatGPT helped with the initial layout and ideas, I did a lot of customization myself to make it work.

In total, AI played a guidance and support role. It helped me understand and debug tricky parts, but I remained in control of the logic, structure, and testing.
